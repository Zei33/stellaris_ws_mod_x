# Stellaris Workshop Mod Converter

You may need to download the .NET 4.6.1 redistributable if you don't have it:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=49982

To use the program, just run stellaris_ws_mod_x.exe

~~You can download the compiled files here https://zeiworld.net/files/zip/stellaris_ws_mod_x_1.0.0.zip~~

Select your Stellaris mod folder (if it doesn't exist, create one and then select it)
Usually found at C:\Users\\\<username>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod

Next select the mod .zip file. 
The zip file should contain the mod files as well as a descriptor.mod file.

Finally hit the Install Mod button.

Good luck, hope it works.
Haven't tested it a lot, don't even own the GOG version of the game. 
Should work in theory but if there are issues, let me know and I'll fix things up.
